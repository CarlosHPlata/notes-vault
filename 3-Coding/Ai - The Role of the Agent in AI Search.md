# ðŸ“ƒ The Role of the Agent in AI Search 19-06-2025

---
In the context of AI, an agent is an autonomous entity that **perceives** its environment and **acts** upon it to achieve specific goals. When solving a search problem, the agent must decide which actions to take in order to reach the **goal state**.

## Definitions
- **Agent:** A system that observes its environment (via *sensors*) and takes actions (via *actuators*)
- **Rational Agent:** Chooses actions that maximize expected performance according to a defined objective.

In search problems the agents:
- Are set in a **known state**.
- Has a set of **possible actions**
- Uses the **transition model** to retrieve the future states $S'$ after taking all possible actions $A$ in the known state $S$.
- Aims to reach **goal state**.
- May optimized based on a **path cost**

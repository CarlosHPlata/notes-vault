# ðŸ“ƒ Informed vs Uninformed Search 19-06-2025


---
Search strategies can be broadly categorized as **uninformed** or **informed**, based on whether they use additional knowledge about the problem domain. The choice between them affects efficiency, completeness, and optimality.

## Uninformed Search (Blind Search)
These strategies do not use **domain-specific knowledge** beyond the problem definition (initial state, actions, transition model, goal test).

## Informed Search (Heuristic Search)
These strategies use **problem-specific knowledge** to guide and find solutions more efficiently, typically through an **heuristic function** called $h(N)$ that estimates the cost of the goal from a given node $N$.

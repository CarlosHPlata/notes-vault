# ðŸ“ƒ Stack Navigator 23-05-2025

---
A stack navigator is the foundation for navigating between different screens in an app.

**On Android**: a stacked route animates on top of the current screen.
**On iOS**:  a stacked route animates from the right.

Normally the stack is placed on the [[Expo - App directory|Layout]] file:
```
app/
    _layout.tsx
```

The Layout file using Stack could look something like this (*v5.08*)
```tsx
import { Stack } from 'expo-router';

export default function RootLayout() {
    return (
        <Stack>
            <Stack.Screen name="inde" options={{title: "Home"}}/>
        </Stack>
    )
}
```

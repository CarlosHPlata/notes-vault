Parametric models are LLM models like chat GPT that work with memory based.
LLMs using parametric models know things because that info is "baked into" their weights, this means they store information of the conversation in their memory as tokens.
Updating their knowledge is expensive and slow.

They tend to [[Ai - Hallucinations|Hallucinate]] because they generate responses based on patterns found in their memory, not facts stored.

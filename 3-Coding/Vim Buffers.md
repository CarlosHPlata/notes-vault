# ðŸ“ƒ Buffers 20-10-2024

>[!tip] A Buffer is an **im memory representation of a file opened**

Buffers are the way VIM present the GUI. by default you are always in a buffer.
Every time you run (vimCmd::`:e namefile` ) it will open a new buffer.

### Movement between buffers
- use (vimCmd::`:bp`) to move forward
- use (vimCmd::bn) to move to previous buffer
- You can list all the buffers with (vimCmd::`buffers`)
- You can init an empty buffer with (vimCmd::`enew`)

# ðŸ“ƒ Buffers 21-10-2024

- A buffer is a view of a file system
- A buffer is contained in a window.

Buffers act as a view **per file** meaning that 2 windows opening the same file are viewing **the same buffer**.

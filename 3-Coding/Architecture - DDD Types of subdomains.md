## Types of subdomains
#### Core Domains
Core domains are domains that **make the business special**, it's the key part of the business that gives you the competitive advantage, *this is where the vast majority of the efforts would be done*.

#### Generic Domains
Are domains that are not the special part of the business but **take a key role on the overall functionality of the business**. This would have special attention and effort but not as high as the core domains.

#### Supporting Domains
Bits that helps the business operates with normality, but **are not a key part of the business**. This have low to zero effort to be put, and sometimes can be outsourced if needed.

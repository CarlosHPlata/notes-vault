# ðŸ“ƒ Mutable references 28-10-2024

---
Let's start with the following example:
```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    give_ownership(&s);
    println!("{}", s); 
}

fn give_ownership(s: &String) {
    s.push_str(", world"); // error
}
```

this previous code will throw an error, that's because *we are trying to modify a non mutable reference*.

To fix this we will have to make a **mutable reference**. The steps to fix this code are:
1. Make `s` a mutable variable.
2. Make the function `give_ownership` receives a mutable reference.

> [!tip] as with [[Rust - variables and types| variables]] the syntax to declare a mutable reference is: `&mut`

So fixing this code is:
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello"); //notice the mut
    give_ownership(&mut s); // notice the &mut
    println!("{}", s); 
}

fn give_ownership(s: &mut String) { // notice the &mut
    s.push_str(", world"); 
}
```

Notice how we first declare `s` as a mutable string and how we will pass it to the rest of the code.

## Restrictions
Mutable reference has one big restriction: **If you have a mutable reference already you can have NO OTHER references to that value**.

## Memory management
The stack and the heap are abstract representations of how the memory is managed by the language.
Is a common conception from other low level languages like *C* or *C++*.

**[[Rust - Memory - The Stack | The stack]]** is fast, and is where memory is normally allocated by rust, is based on a stack of course. And the data is local on the context to a function call. *is limited on size*.

**[[Rust - Memory - The Heap| The Heap]]** is slow, but the advantage is that is globally accessible and unlimited in size. However the data is allocated randomly.

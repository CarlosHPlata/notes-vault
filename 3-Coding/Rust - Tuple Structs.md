# ðŸ“ƒ Tuple Structs 01-11-2024

---
Rust also support structs that look similar to tuples, called tuple structs.
This is useful if you have a type of tuple that you repeat often and want to give it a context and a name:

```rust
struct Point(i32, i32);
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);

fn main() {
  let my_point = Point(1, 2);
  let black = (0, 0, 0);
}
```

# ðŸ“ƒ Functional Requirements 14-05-2025

---
Functional requirements define the expected behavior of a system. They describe _what the system must do_, which usually aligns with business goals or user actions.

In system design, it's one of the very first steps is to extract these from a vague problem statement. This includes asking questions like:
- Who are the users?
- What do they want to achieve?
- What must the system provide or do in response?

When approaching functional requirements:
- Bullet-point them clearly and concisely
- Donâ€™t try to capture every single detailâ€”focus on whatâ€™s core
- Try to surface hidden assumptions (e.g., do users need authentication?)

Later, these requirements will anchor your API, domain model, and service boundaries.

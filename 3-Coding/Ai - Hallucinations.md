> AI Hallucination is a phenomenon where, in a large LLM, perceives patterns or objects that are nonexistent or imperceptible to human observers, creating outputs that are nonsensical or altogether inaccurate.

In other words is the phenomenon where a LLM returns responses that have no sense, this happens when it has to deal with large sets of data, and starts relating topics that have no context between.

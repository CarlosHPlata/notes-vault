# ðŸ“ƒ Passing variables with same name to Structs 01-11-2024

---
Let's take this example:
```rust
fn create_pokemon(name: String, life: u8) {
  pokemon {
    name: name,
    life: like,
    enemy: true
  }
}
```

>[!tip] notice the variable names and the properties of the struct are the same

we can short this by just writing the name, if you came from *JavaScript* this will be similar.

```rust
fn create_pokemon(name: String, life: u8) {
  pokemon {
    name,
    life,
    enemy: true
  }
}
```

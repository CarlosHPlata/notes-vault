A **graph** is a mathematical structure used to model pairwise relations between entities. It consists of **nodes (vertices)** and **edges (links)** that connect pairs of nodes.

## Types of Graphs:
- **Directed vs Undirected:** Edges have direction or not
- **Weighted vs Unweighted:** Edges carry values (e.g., cost, distance) or not
- **Cyclic vs Acyclic:** Contains loops or is loop-free
- **Connected vs Disconnected:** All nodes reachable vs not all reachable

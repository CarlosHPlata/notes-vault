# ðŸ“ƒ Architecture as a form of communication 12-05-2025

> The software architecture of a system is the set of structures needed to reason about the system. These structures comprise software elements, relations among them. and properties of both.
> *- Bass, Clements, Kazman*

The aim of the architecture is to translate the way the domain operates into something that is understandable by the technical staff.

The architecture abstracts the spoken language of the business operation that's represented.

The architecture constructs structures around the domain, and form relationships among them as a way of communicating those structures. This is mimic of the way the operation of the business communicates with each other.

How do the payments operations communicate with the compliance operations part of the business? perhaps they sent a report every month.
This later is translated to the architecture, perhaps and endpoint to send the payment summary every month

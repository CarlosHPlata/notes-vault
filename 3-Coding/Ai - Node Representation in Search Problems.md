# ðŸ“ƒ Node Representation in Search Problems 19-06-2025

---
In AI Search algorithms, a **node** is an internal data structure used to represent a point in the search space. While the **State** defines the external configuration (e.g. agent's position), the **node** tracks additional metadata required for traversing, expanding, and reconstructing solutions.

A node typically stores:
- **State**: The current configuration in the environment.
- **Parent Node**: A reference to the node which this one was generated when explored.
- **Action**: The action that was taken to reach the node from its parent.
- **Path Cost** $g(N)$: The accumulative cost from the initial state to this node.

This structure enables:
- **Backtracking**
- **Path reconstruction**
- **Cost calculation**

Example:
```yaml
Node:
 â”œâ”€ state: (x, y)
 â”œâ”€ parent: reference to previous node
 â”œâ”€ action: 'move-right'
 â””â”€ path_cost: 6
```

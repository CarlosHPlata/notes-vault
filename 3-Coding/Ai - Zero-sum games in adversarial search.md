A **zero-sum game** is a competitive scenario where one player's gain is exactly balanced by another player's loss. **In artificial intelligence**, especially in [[Ai - Adversarial Search|Adversarial Search]], this property is used to model two-player deterministic games like *chess* or *tic-tac-toe*.

## Definition
> For all states $S$ in $TerminalStates$ the result of the $utility$ for player a $pa$ is the inverse of the $utility$ for player b.

$$\forall S \in \text{TerminalStates}, \text{Utility}_{pa}(S) = -\text{Utility}_{pb}(S)$$

## 🎯 Course Description

This course is focused on **High-Level Architecture**, where students learn to make system-wide decisions that impact scalability, reliability, and integration. Students will work in simulated agile teams, building a distributed system composed of multiple microservices. Each team will own one or more services and collaborate with other teams to ensure interoperability, scalability, and robustness.

> [!warning] **Disclaimer:**
> This course simulates a tech company and its engineering workflows, but it is a **mocked exercise purely for educational purposes**. Students will **not be asked to contribute to any real commercial product**, nor will any intellectual property be extracted from the work done here. The intent is to **teach architectural thinking**, technical collaboration, and give students a sense of what it’s like to work at top-tier companies such as Oracle, Rappi, or Klarna.

Students will learn how to apply architectural patterns, use industry tools in real environments such as Docker, GitHub Actions, Prometheus, and OpenAPI, and practice technical leadership, documentation, and peer collaboration. The course culminates in a final system integration and team showcase.

Each class begins with a **daily stand-up**, where teams briefly share progress, blockers, and plans. This helps simulate agile rhythms and keeps everyone aligned.

# 📘 Course Proposal: Software Architecture in Practice

## 🆔 Course Information
- **Course Name:** Software Architecture in Practice
- **Department:** Software Engineering
- **Level:** Undergraduate – Final Year
- **Semester:** 8th or 9th
- **Duration:** 12 weeks (but I really think it will be extended to 16)

---

## 🎯 Course Objective

This course prepares students to design, build, and evaluate distributed systems by simulating the structure and workflow of a real software company. Students are organized into agile teams, each responsible for developing a microservice. Through collaboration, integration, and architectural challenges, they will gain practical experience applying software architecture principles in a high-stakes, team-based environment.

---

## 📘 Summary

"Software Architecture in Practice" bridges the gap between theory and real-world engineering. Students form development teams and simulate a company building a complex, distributed product. Each team owns a microservice, contributing to an evolving system that grows in complexity throughout the semester.

Architecture is treated as an evolving, collaborative discipline—students are introduced to industry standards like Domain-Driven Design, CQRS, API design with OpenAPI, containerization, CI/CD, observability tools (Grafana, Prometheus, Loki), and more.

## ✅ Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- Analyze and apply architectural patterns and quality attributes.
- Design and document services using Domain-Driven Design (DDD).
- Define and consume APIs using OpenAPI contracts.
- Containerize applications using Docker and configure CI/CD pipelines.
- Monitor distributed systems with logs, metrics, and dashboards.
- Justify architectural decisions through ADRs and review sessions.
- Collaborate effectively in cross-functional, agile teams.
- Demonstrate leadership and communication skills in a simulated team environment.

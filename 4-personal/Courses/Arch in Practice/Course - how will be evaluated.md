# ðŸ“ƒ How will be evaluated 10-05-2025

---
## Engagement & participation
> [!danger] 10%

The course will need all of the students to attend to the classes but most will be assessed through subjective participation, in each class I will ask questions to the students if I feel they participated enough they get the points.

## Module Deliverables & Teamwork
> [!danger] 30%

The deliverables for this course are different there's no individual assignments but instead group assignments, by team, they shall work as a team to contribute to a major project, each week they shall report through their leader and the result of every deliverable is measured by their project assignments.

## Final Demo
>[!danger] 60%

The Final Demo is the most important one, either **all of the group get the 60% or none**, the final demo is all the application working together in a secure `docker-compose` environment. If the entire class project works then all get the points, if it does not work then all them struggle.

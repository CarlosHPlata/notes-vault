## ðŸš€ Notes
- Open a slack thread to make differences with US and EU.
- this class creates and decide for aggregated InvoicePaymentMethodsCreator
- How does the Aggregated Flow works:
    - check this ticket for more information: https://klarna.atlassian.net/browse/PAMS-5795

    1. The flow is initiated from the initiate flow through
        1.1 PaymentOptionsStage > PopulatePaymentMethodOptionsStep > InvoicePaymentMethodsCreator

    2. The InvoicePaymentMethodsCreator is the one in charge of determine when is an Aggregated Payment Method
        Check the `createPaymentMethods` to see how the entire flow is parsed
        Check the `parseAggregation` method to know how to parse the aggregation
        Check the `product offering is compatible` to know how it parse it to regular invoice or not

    3. Small note, to know how a payment method is clasified as Aggregated check this:
        3.1 **The current flow:** For a payment method to be selected in US for aggregated PLX:
            It should be token or buy_and_tokenize inten
            It should have SCAL (settlement calendar active).
        3.2 **The old flow** For GB it should be enough to have token or buy_and_tokenize intent
 
**Changes for GB PLX**
    1.  Since the flow differs from US and UK we should ask how to implement both flows in the
        `InvoicePaymentMethodsCreator`
        Options are: differ the creators by market like DecisionService ones or create some sort of config.
        1.1 In what they differ: For US PLX is hidden if no settlement calendar is enabled, in UK SCAL is no needed
        1.2 For this reason exists this ticket: https://klarna.atlassian.net/browse/PEM-9862
    2. Talking about `PEM-9862` in the UK the PLX has to be offered without SCAL that means that some default values needs to be set as default and they need to be sent to the Persona Gateway
        2.1 There's an extra requirement if the user had SCAL disabled it has to just enable it.
        2.2 This should occur at the end of the flow after the user accept the purchase.
    3. The new persona gateway endpoint has to be enabled by this ticket: https://klarna.atlassian.net/browse/PEM-9863.

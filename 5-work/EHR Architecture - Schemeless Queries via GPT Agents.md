# ðŸ“ƒ Schemeless Queries via GPT Agents 

---
Traditional search is based on schema-bound queries or static filters, GPT Agents instead perform **Natural Language Queries** often vague or exploratory.

The [[EHR Architecture - Semantic Index|Semantic Index]] supports **vector-based similarity search** *(schemeless)*:
- Map intent to relevant semantic objects.
- Allows context-aware filtering even if fields or structure vary across services.
- Supports **voice** and **free-text input** as primary modes.

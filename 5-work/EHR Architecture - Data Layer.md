# 📃 Data Layer

---
The **Data Layer** is responsible for managing, transforming, and serving the core **clinical and operational data** required by both the [[EHR Architecture - CDA Assistant Framework|CDA Assistant Framework Service]] (LLMs, planners, semantic engines) and traditional **backend services** in the [[EHR Architecture - Service Layer|Service Layer]].

Unlike conventional data layers that operate solely on **relational schemas**, this layer serves as a [[Ai - Semantic Index|Semantic Index]] including **hybrid data representation**, combining **relational, graph, and vector-based storage** to support intelligent access patterns and contextual understanding.

It uses the [[Ai - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)|Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)]] technique to store and manipulate data.

## Key Responsibilities

- Acts as the **single source of truth** for healthcare information, primarily sourced from the **V500 database** (source-of-record EHR).
- Transforms raw clinical data into [[General - Semantic Object|semantic-rich objects]] interpretable by downstream agents.
- Serves both **symbolic queries** (e.g., SQL or graph traversal) and **semantic queries** (e.g., [[EHR Architecture - RAG Embeddings|embedding]] similarity).
- Supports **[[Ai - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)|Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)]]**, enabling large language models to augment their reasoning with contextual data retrieved at inference time.

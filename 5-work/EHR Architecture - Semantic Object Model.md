# ðŸ“ƒ Semantic Object Model 

---
Raw inputs are **enriched** into a [[General - Semantic Object|Semantic Object Model]] aligned to the [FHIR standard](https://hl7.org/fhir). These objects represent normalized entities, extended with custom fields for internal decision support.

This enables LLM to operate over **structured**, **contextualized** data, reducing [[Ai - Hallucinations|Hallucination]] and improving grounding.

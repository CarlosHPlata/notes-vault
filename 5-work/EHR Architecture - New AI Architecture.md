# ðŸ“ƒ EHR New AI Architecture 18-06-2025

---

In the new architecture for EHR Systems AI is the new driver and central concept of the architecture.
GPT agents infuse AI into every layer of the architecture. They operate on [[General - Semantic Object|Semantic Objects]] which are data retrieved from the Millennium v500 databases and transformed into JSON structures following the [FHIR Standard Specification for exchanging healthcare information electronically](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html).

Then later in the process this data is enriched with ontology and metadata information.

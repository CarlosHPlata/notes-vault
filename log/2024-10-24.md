## ðŸš€ Notes

Performance tests steps
1. Adjust the number/size of instances in pams-monorepo then deploy to performance environment
2. Scale up risk-mock-service
3. Disable logs from performance environments
4. Remember not to run 2 tests for different payment options in the same region at the same time, as they will both use risk-mock-service and the service might become slower and affect the result. It's ok to run tests for different payment options in different regions at the same time
5. Look into the weight of the operations
6. Adjust thresholds for initiate and authorize - from DataDog
7. Setup the desired number of VUS (needs improvements)
8. Run tests
9. Stop or scale down risk-mock-service and the payment method service performance environment
10. Analyze the results

Steps from meeting:
- Check Service Health Dashboard to see the instances
- use grond to increase the instances
    `grond environment scale -n pay-now-payment-method-service -p eu -s performance --minimum-instances 3`
- do the dame for risk mock services
    `gron enviroment sclae -n risk-mock-service -p eu -s performance --minimum-instances 1`
- make sure that is not loggin.
- Modify the threshhold for the current test in the performance test repo `pay-now-payment-method-service/../constants.js`
    - check in datadot service health for the P99 API responses
    - create a new branch wait for the job to finish
    - once the jenkins job finish it will promtp you to enter the data.
    - once the job is running it will be shown in K6

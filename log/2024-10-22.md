# 📅 Daily Log 2024-10-22

---
## 🔷 Daily Tasks
- [x] fix EU failed performance tests 
- [ ] add oschestrator to the riskmock service

---
# 💼Work 
## 🚀 Notes
- aparently the performance tests are failing due missing steps in the performance tests
- to run the performance tests from the pipeline you have to push your branch, enter the blue ocean mode in jenkins.
    - once is deployed it will ask you to enter the parameters
- for risk mock services add DO and check the delays in datadog and adjust it.
- if it's not a big dead add the DO and map of jade to all services

# 👑 Personal
## 📕 Reminders
- [ ] Create a gym dashboard to track my progress

Obsidian nvim is a plugin designed for NeoVim that allow you to run obsidian actions in your vault is kinda hard to configure but is worth if you cannot install the true application.

## Worth to know commands:

### Create a note

- `:ObsidianSearch [Name]` to search for or create notes in your vault using `ripgrep` and [[Telescope|telescope]]

- `:ObsidianExtractNote [Title]` to extract the visual selected text into a new note and link to it.

### configuration

in order to this file to work you need to configure it properly check the resource to check how to do it

this is my configuration:

```lua
return {
	"epwalsh/obsidian.nvim",
	version = "*", -- recommended, use latest release instead of latest commit
	lazy = true,
	ft = "markdown",
	-- Replace the above line with this if you only want to load obsidian.nvim for markdown files in your vault:
	-- event = {
	--   -- If you want to use the home shortcut '~' here you need to call 'vim.fn.expand'.
	--   -- E.g. "BufReadPre " .. vim.fn.expand "~" .. "/my-vault/*.md"
	--   -- refer to `:h file-pattern` for more examples
	--   "BufReadPre path/to/my-vault/*.md",
	--   "BufNewFile path/to/my-vault/*.md",
	-- },
	dependencies = {
		"nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
	},
	opts = {
		workspaces = {
			{
				name = "personal",
				path = "~/Projects/notes-vault",
			},
		},
		daily_notes = {
			folder = "dailyNotes",
			template = "DailyLog.md",
		},
		templates = {
			folder = "1Obsidian/templates",
		},
    picker = {
      name = "telescope.nvim",

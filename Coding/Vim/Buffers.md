# ðŸ“ƒ Buffers 20-10-2024

---

Buffers are the way VIM present the GUI. by default you are always in a buffer.
Every time you run (vimCmd::`:e namefile` ) it will open a new buffer.

### Movement between buffers
- use (vimCmd::`:bp`) to move forward
- use (vimCmd::bn) to move to previous buffer
- You can list all the buffers with (vimCmd::`buffers`)
- You can init an empty buffer with (vimCmd::`enew`)


## ðŸ“œ Notes and Ideas

If you have installed [[Coding/Vim/Plugins/Telescope|Telescope]] it will help you to navigate through buffers

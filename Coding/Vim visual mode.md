>[!tip] enter visual mode by hitting `v` in [[vim normal mode]]

When editing a text in Vim, visual mode is a great way to **select** text and manipulate it.

Vim's Visual mode has three versions:
1. Character mode (normal visual mode) `v`
2. Line mode: `shifth + v`
3. Block mode: `ctr + v`

**You can switch the side of the cursor between something selected using `o`**
## Character mode `v`
Is the normal way to access visual mode, it selects character by character use the normal movements ([[Vim jump List paragraphs and block jumps]]) to select things.
## Lime mode `shift + v`
Using linear mode will allow to **Select the entire lines** you can use movements to traverse as usual.

## Block mode `ctr + v`
This is like [[multi cursors visual code]] let you select different parts of a text is useful when commenting an entire block of code or editing at the beginning or end of a line

## Visual line mode
You can go into visual line mode with `shift+v`

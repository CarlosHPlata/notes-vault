# ðŸ“ƒ vim yank tricks  26-10-2024

---
this trick will prevent you to put content when you copy something
```lua
xnoremap("<leader>p", "\"_dP")
nnoremap("<leader>d", "\"_dp")
vnoremap("<leader>d", "\"_dp")
```

To understand this remap we will have to visit [[Coding/Vim/registers]]
But basically it moves the content that was deleted to the underscore register, which is the void register, so to the thrash.

## ðŸ“ƒNotes 
### Vectors
Vectors keyword is `Vec<T>`.
Vectors allow you to store more than one value in a single data structure that puts all the values next to each other in memory.

> Vectors can only store values of the same type

To create a new vector:

```rust
let v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
```

>More often, youâ€™ll create aÂ `Vec<T>`Â with initial values and Rust will infer the type of value you want to store

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3]; // vecttor of <i32>
```

Pushing into a vector:
```rust
let mut v = Vec::new();
v.push(5);
v.push(6);
v.push(7);
```

>There are two ways to reference a value stored in a vector: via indexing or by using theÂ `get`Â method.

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let third: &i32 = &v[2];

let third: Option<&i32> = v.get(2);
match third {
  Some(third) => println!("third el {}", third),
  None => println!("No element")
}
```

When using `[]` Rust will cause the program to panic if outside bounds.
When using `get` Rust will return `None` if outside of bounds.

#### Iterating over a vector
To access each element you can iterate over the indices with a for loop:
```rust
let v = vec![100, 32, 57];
for i in &v {
  println!("{i}")
}
```

Or with mutable:
```rust
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3];
for i in &mut v {
  *i += 50;
}
```

> To change the value that the mutable reference refers to, we have to use theÂ `*`Â dereference operator to get to the value inÂ `i`Â before we can use theÂ `+=`Â operator.

#### Using an Enum to Store multiple types

```rust
enum SpreadshetCell {
  Int(i32),
  Text(String),
}

let row = vec![
  SpreadsheetCell:Int(2),
  SpreadsheetCell:Text(String::from("hello world")),
]
```

Vectors and elements are dropped at the end of the scope.

### Strings
> Â Rust has only one string type in the core language, which is the string sliceÂ `str`

> TheÂ `String`Â type, which is provided by Rustâ€™s standard library rather than coded into the core language, is a growable, mutable, owned, UTF-8 encoded string type.

> Many of the same operations available withÂ `Vec<T>`Â are available withÂ `String`Â as well becauseÂ `String`Â is actually implemented as a wrapper around a vector

> For that, we use theÂ `to_string`Â method, Â which is available on any type that implements theÂ `Display`Â trait

> Remember that strings are UTF-8 encoded, so we can include any properly encoded data in them

> Often, youâ€™ll want to combine two existing strings. One way to do so is to use theÂ `+`Â operator

The stringÂ `s3`Â will containÂ `Hello, world!`. The reasonÂ `s1`Â is no longer valid after the addition, and the reason we used a reference toÂ `s2`, has to do with the signature of the method thatâ€™s called when we use theÂ `+`Â operator. TheÂ `+`Â operator uses theÂ `add`Â method, whose signature looks something like this:

`fn add(self, s: &str) -> String {`

> AÂ `String`Â is a wrapper over aÂ `Vec<u8>`

> The best way to operate on pieces of strings is to be explicit about whether you want characters or bytes. For individual Unicode scalar values, use theÂ `chars`

### Hash Maps

> The last of our common collections is theÂ _hash map_. The typeÂ `HashMap<K, V>`

> One way to create an empty hash map is to useÂ `new`Â and to add elements withÂ `insert`

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();

scores.insert(String::from("blue"), 10);
```

> Just like vectors, hash maps store their data on the heap.

> hash maps are homogeneous: all of the keys must have the same type

> We can get a value out of the hash map by providing its key to theÂ `get`Â method,

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap

let mut scores = HashMap::new();
socres.insert(String::from("blue"), 10);

let team_name = String::from("blue");
let score = scores.get(&team_name).copied().unwrap_or(0);
```

>TheÂ `get`Â method returns anÂ `Option<&V>`

> This program handles theÂ `Option`Â by callingÂ `copied`Â to get anÂ `Option<i32>`Â rather than anÂ `Option<&i32>`

> Â thenÂ `unwrap_or`Â to setÂ `score`Â to zero ifÂ `scores`Â doesnâ€™t have an entry for the key.

> We can iterate over each keyâ€“value pair in a hash map in a similar manner as we do with vectors, using aÂ `for`Â loop:

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();
scores.insert(String::from("blue"), 10);

for (key, value) in &scores {
  println!("{key}: {value}")
}
```

> Â iterating over a hash map happens in an arbitrary order

> For types that implement theÂ `Copy`Â trait, likeÂ `i32`, the values are copied into the hash map. For owned values likeÂ `String`, the values will be moved and the hash map will be the owner of those values

> Hash maps have a special API for this calledÂ `entry`Â that takes the key you want to check as a parameter.

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();
scores.insert(String::from("blue"), 10);

scores.entry(String::from("blue")).or_insert(50);
```

> TheÂ `or_insert`Â method onÂ `Entry`Â is defined to return a mutable reference to the value for the correspondingÂ `Entry`Â key if that key exists, and if not, it inserts the parameter as the new value for this key and returns a mutable reference to the new value.

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();
scores.insert(String::from("blue"), 10);

let score = map.entry(word).or_insert(0);
*count += 1;
```

> By default,Â `HashMap`Â uses a hashing function calledÂ _SipHash_Â that can provide resistance to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks

> you can switch to another function by specifying a different hasher. AÂ _hasher_Â is a type that implements theÂ `BuildHasher`Â trait.

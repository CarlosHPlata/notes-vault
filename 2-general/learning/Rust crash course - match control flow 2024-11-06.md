# ðŸ”¥ match control flow 2024-11-06 

---
## ðŸ“ƒNotes 
>Rust has an extremely powerful control flow construct called match that allows you to compare a value against a series of patterns and then execute code based on which pattern matches. 

> Patterns can be made up of literal values, variable names, wildcards, and many other things;

Match is like a switch but steroids.

```rust
enum Coin {
  Penny,
  Nickel,
  Dime,
  Quarter,
}

fn value_in_cents(coing: Coin) -> u8 {
  match coin {
    Coin::Penny => 1,
    Coin::Nickel => 5,
    Coin::Dime => 10,
    Coin::Quarter => 25,
  }
}
```

When code is short within the match you can't skip the use of brackets, but if you need to add more logic you can use brackets.

```rust
fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
  match coin {
    Coin::Penny => {
      println!("Hello");
      1
    } // notice no comma at the end
  }
}
```

You can bind variables to the content of the match as if they are functions.

```rust
enum Type {
  Fire,
  Ice,
}

enum Creature {
  Human,
  Dragon(Type)
}

fn get_creature_id(creature: Creature) -> u8 {
  match creature {
    Creature::Human => 1,
    Creature::Dragon(type) => {
      println!("This dragon is type {type:?}!")
      2
    }
  }
}
```

**Matches are exhaustive** meaning that `match` should cover all possibilities.

**Default**

```rust
let dice_roll = 9;
match dice_roll {
  3 => add_something(),
  7 => remove_something(),
  other => do_something(),
}
```

> The other is like a variable that catch all other possibilities.

>patterns are evaluated in order. If we put the catch-all arm earlier, the other arms would never run, so Rust will warn us if we add arms after a catch-all!

>Rust also has a pattern we can use when we want a catch-all but donâ€™t want to use the value in the catch-all pattern: _ is a special pattern that matches any value and does not bind to that value. This tells Rust we arenâ€™t going to use the value, so Rust wonâ€™t warn us about an unused variable.

```rust
match dice_roll {
  3 => add_something(),
  7 => remove_something(),
  _ => do_something(),
}
```

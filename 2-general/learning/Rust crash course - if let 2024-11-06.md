## ğŸ“ƒNotes 

> TheÂ `if let`Â syntax lets you combineÂ `if`Â andÂ `let`Â into a less verbose way to handle values that match one pattern while ignoring the rest.

```rust
let config_max = Some(3u8);
match config_max {
  Some(max) => println!("The max is ${max}"),
  _ => (),
}
```

> Instead, we could write this in a shorter way usingÂ `if let`.

```rust
let config_max = Some(3u8);
if let Some(max) = config_max {
  println!("The max is ${max}");
}
```

**Notice the way is written `let Some(max)`** this is the type we are comparing to, and `max` is the variable we want to use.
In short we are saying `if config_max is equal to something that looks like type Some(max) [Some with variable max]`

>It works the same way as aÂ `match`, where the expression is given to theÂ `match`Â and the pattern is its first arm.

> We can include anÂ `else`Â with anÂ `if let`. The block of code that goes with theÂ `else`Â is the same as the block of code that would go with theÂ `_`Â case in theÂ `match`Â expression that is equivalent to theÂ `if let`Â andÂ `else`.

```rust
let mut count = 0;
if let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin {
  println!("State quarter from {state:?}!");
} else {
  count += 1;
}
```

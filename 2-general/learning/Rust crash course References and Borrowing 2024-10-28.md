# ðŸ”¥ Rust crash course References and Borrowing 2024-10-28 

---
## ðŸ“ƒNotes 
- References can be taken using `&` prefix
- we can pass a reference to something and borrow the reference to a value
- When creating a reference rust creates a pointer to the variable
- **References must always be valid** (lifetime)
- Mutable reference can be passed using `&mut` as long as the variable is `mutable`
- `*` will de reference of a value usefull if you want to write from or write to a value.
- **An either given time you can have exactly one mutable reference or any number of inmutable reference**
- All rules are enforced by the compiler

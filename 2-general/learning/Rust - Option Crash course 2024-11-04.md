# ðŸ”¥ Rust - Option 2024-11-04

## ðŸ“ƒNotes 
> Rust does not have nulls

> it does have an enum that can encode the concept of a value being present or absent. This enum isÂ `Option<T>`, and it isÂ [defined by the standard library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html)Â as follows:

```rust
enum Option<T> {
  None,
  Some(T),
}
```

>Â enum is so useful that itâ€™s even included in the prelude; you donâ€™t need to bring it into scope explicitly. Its variants are also included in the prelude: you can useÂ `Some`Â andÂ `None`Â directly without theÂ `Option::`Â prefix.

> Eliminating the risk of incorrectly assuming a not-null value helps you to be more confident in your code.

> TheÂ `match`Â expression is a control flow construct that does just this when used with enums: it will run different code depending on which variant of the enum it has, and that code can use the data inside the matching value.

>enums give you a way of saying a value is one of a possible set of values.

To declare an enum we can use:
```rust
enum IpAddrKind {
  V4,
  V6,
}
```

To use an enum:
```rust
let four = IpAddrKind::V4;
```

We can pass things to the enums like in Java:
```rust
enum IpAddr {
  V4(String),
  V6(String),
}

let home = IpAddr::V4(String::from("127.0.0.1"));
```

>he name of each enum variant that we define also becomes a function that constructs an instance of the enum.

>Thereâ€™s another advantage to using an enum rather than a struct: each variant can have different types and amounts of associated data.

```rust
enum IpAddr {
  V4(u8, u8, u8, u8),
  V6(String),
}

let home = IpAddr::V4(127, 0, 0, 1);
let other = IpAddr::V6("::1");
```

> you can put any kind of data inside an enum variant

```rust
struct Ipv4Addr {
    // --snip--
}

struct Ipv6Addr {
    // --snip--
}

enum IpAddr {
    V4(Ipv4Addr),
    V6(Ipv6Addr),
}
```

There are more varians

```rust
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}
```
This enum has four variants with different types:

- `Quit`Â has no data associated with it at all.
- `Move`Â has named fields, like a struct does.
- `Write`Â includes a singleÂ `String`.
- `ChangeColor`Â includes threeÂ `i32`Â values.

> just as weâ€™re able to define methods on structs usingÂ `impl`, weâ€™re also able to define methods on enums.

___
## ðŸ§¾ Project Description

Recoveries and rejection
- Recover and map rejection codes from PAMS to Client for rejection
- `DeclineReason` has rejections difference between US and The rest of the market
- We will receive a US rejection code and get a different rejection based on the map

- That's for all payment methods
- Test: ensure that for the US we are receiving the right code and the rest of markets we return different one.

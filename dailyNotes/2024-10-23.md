    - Growth rate we get it checking the stimations from their mocked stimation
    - for base line we can see the graphics and stimate, we stimate 30 operation per second, and the baseline is 720
    - How to calculate the FLAS capacity we start from the base line and we add an additional FLAS
        - FLAS is the difference between last year peak and the original baseline
    - After the calculations we have to make a PR to the capacity repo, check the docs on how to do it.
    - PMI doesn't have historical numbers we have to overestimate using Pay Later and Pay By Card [slice it] numbers
    - check the datadog service health dashboard.

- [f] For the issue that I didn't know what happened that I cannot deploy to staging, the solution is to login into docker: `docker login l-docker-pams-staging.artifactory.klarna.net`

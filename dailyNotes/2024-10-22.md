## ğŸ”· Daily Tasks
- [x] fix EU failed performance tests

# ğŸ’¼Work 
## ğŸš€ Notes
- aparently the performance tests are failing due missing steps in the performance tests
- to run the performance tests from the pipeline you have to push your branch, enter the blue ocean mode in jenkins.
    - once is deployed it will ask you to enter the parameters
- for risk mock services add DO and check the delays in datadog and adjust it.
- if it's not a big dead add the DO and map of jade to all services
